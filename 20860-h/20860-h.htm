<h2>
    INTRODUCTION.
</h2>
<p>
Early in the present century John Harris&mdash;one of the successors to the
business of "Honest John Newbery," now carried on by Messrs Griffith &amp;
Farran at the old corner of St. Paul's Churchyard&mdash;began the publication
of a series of little books, which for many years were probably among
the most famous of the productions of the House. Now, however, according
to the fate which usually overtakes books for children, nearly all of
them are forgotten or unknown.
</p>
<p>
The first book in this series which was known as <i>Harris's Cabinet</i>
was "The Butterfly's Ball," and was published in January 1807. This was
followed in the same year by "The Peacock at Home" (a sequel to "The
Butterfly's Ball"), "The Elephant's Ball," and "The Lion's Masquerade;"
and then (prompted no doubt by the success of these, for we learn on the
publisher's authority that of the two first 40,000 copies were sold
within twelve months) Mr Harris brought out a

<span class="pagenum"><a id="pageiv" name="pageiv"></a>[iv]</span>

                                              torrent of little books
of a like kind, of which the titles were: "The Lioness's Ball," "The
Lobster's Voyage to the Brazils," "The Cat's Concert," "The Fishes'
Grand Gala," "Madame Grimalkin's Party," "The Jackdaw's Home," "The
Lion's Parliament," "The Water King's Levée;" and in 1809, by which
time, naturally enough, the idea seems to have become quite threshed out
and exhausted, the last of the Series was published; this was entitled,
"The Three Wishes, or Think before you Speak."
</p>
<p>
Of this long list of books a few of the titles are still familiar, and
one of them, "The Butterfly's Ball," may certainly claim to have become
a Nursery Classic. It is still in regular demand; the edition now in
sale being illustrated by Harrison Weir; it has been published in
various forms, and has figured in most of the collections of prose and
verse for the young that have been issued during this century. Probably
to the minds of hundreds of people past middle age few lines are more
familiar than the opening couplet&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">  "Come take up your hats, and away let us haste</p>
<p class="i3">   To the Butterfly's Ball and Grasshopper's Feast"&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p style="text-indent: 0;">
and many no doubt by a little effort of memory could repeat
the whole poem.
</p>
<p>
Hardly less famous were the three books which next

<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagev" name="pagev"></a>[v]</span>

                                                   followed in order of
issue&mdash;"The Peacock at Home," "The Elephant's Ball," and "The Lion's
Masquerade." Their original size was 5 by 4 inches, and they were issued
in a simple printed paper wrapper. It is of these first four books that
the reprint is here given, and in order to present both pictures and
text with greater effect this reprint has been made upon considerably
larger paper; the text and illustrations are fac-simile reproductions
of originals from the celebrated Flaxman collection recently dispersed
at a sale by Messrs Christie, Manson, &amp; Woods, when Mr Tuer, to whom
I am indebted for their loan, became their fortunate possessor. "The
Butterfly's Ball" is not a reproduction of the first edition, which, as
will be shown later on, would be considered by those who are familiar
with the poem as incomplete. Moreover, the illustrations in the edition
here presented are obviously by the same hand as that which embellished
the other three books, and it was felt that for these reasons it would
possess a greater interest.
</p>
<p>
"The Butterfly's Ball" first appeared in the November number of the
<i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, where it is said to have been written by William
Roscoe&mdash;M.P. for Liverpool, the author of "The Life of Leo X.," and well
known in the literary circles of his day&mdash;for the use of his children,
and set to music by order of their Majesties for the Princess Mary.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagevi" name="pagevi"></a>[vi]</span>

 When the verses were subsequently published in book form, the text
and pictures were engraved together on copperplates. An edition, with
pictures on separate pages, appeared early in the next year, which is
the one here reproduced.
</p>
<p>
In this edition there are many variations from the previous one. The
allusions to "little Robert"&mdash;evidently William Roscoe's son&mdash;do not
occur in the former, and many slight improvements, tending to make the
verses more rhythmical and flowing, are introduced. The whole passage,
"Then close on his haunches" (p. 7) to "Chirp his own praises the rest
of the night," &amp;c. (p. 10), is an interpolation in this later edition.
It is, I believe, certain that the verses were written by Roscoe for
his children on the occasion of the birthday of his son Robert, who was
nearly the youngest of his seven sons. No doubt when they were copied
out for setting to music the allusions to his own family were omitted by
the author. A correspondent of <i>Notes and Queries</i>&mdash;who is, I believe,
a niece of the late Sir George Smart&mdash;says, in reference to the question
of the setting of the verses to music, that&mdash;
</p>
<p class="quote">
    "The MS., in Roscoe's own handwriting, as sent to Sir G. Smart
    for setting to music, is in a valuable collection of autographs
    bequeathed by the musician to his daughter. The glee was written
    for the three princesses&mdash;Elizabeth, Augusta, and Mary&mdash;daughters
    of George III, and pupils of Sir George, and was performed by them
    during one of their usual visits to Weymouth."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagevii" name="pagevii"></a>[vii]</span>
</p>
<p>
"The Peacock at Home" and "The Lion's Masquerade" were, as the
title-page puts it, written "by a Lady," and we should most likely
have remained in ignorance as to who the lady was if there had not
been published in 1816 another little book of a somewhat similar
character, entitled "The Peacock and Parrot on their Tour to discover
the Author of 'The Peacock at Home,'" which, the Preface tells us, was
written immediately after the appearance of "The Peacock at Home,"
but from various circumstances was laid aside. "In the opinion of the
publishers," the Preface goes on to say, "it is so nearly allied in
point of merit to that celebrated trifle that it is introduced at this
late period."
</p>
<p>
The book relates in verse how the peacock and parrot&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i8">         "... far as England extends </p>
<p class="i2">   Then together did travel to visit their friends, </p>
<p class="i2">   Endeavour to find out the name of our poet, </p>
<p class="i2">   And ere we return ten to one that we know it." </p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
After long travelling&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   "A path strewed with flowers they gaily pursued, </p>
<p class="i3">    And in fancy their long-sought Incognita viewed. </p>
<p class="i3">    Till all their cares over in Dorset they found her, </p>
<p class="i3">    And plucking a wreath of green bay-leaves they crowned her." </p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
In a footnote is added, "Mrs Dorset was the authoress of 'The Peacock
at Home.'"
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pageviii" name="pageviii"></a>[viii]</span>
</p>
<p>
Mrs Dorset, according to a note by Mr Dyce which appears on the fly-leaf
of a copy of "The Peacock at Home," in the Dyce and Forster Collection
at South Kensington, was sister to Charlotte Smith. Their maiden name
was Turner.
</p>
<p>
The British Museum Catalogue says Mrs Dorset also wrote "The Three
Wishes, or Think before you Speak," which is the last on the list of
books in <i>Harris's Cabinet</i>. (<i>See</i> p. iv.)
</p>
<p>
It seems to be clear that the same lady wrote "The Lion's Masquerade" as
"The Peacock at Home," for in "The Lioness's Ball" (a companion to "The
Lion's Masquerade") the dedication begins thus&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   "I do not, fair Dorset, I do not aspire, </p>
<p class="i5">      With notes so unhallowed as mine, </p>
<p class="i3">    To touch the sweet strings of thy beautiful lyre, </p>
<p class="i5">      Or covet the praise that is thine." </p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
I regret that I am unable to offer any conjecture here as to the "W. B."
who wrote "The Elephant's Ball:" the same initials appear to an appendix
to an edition of "Goody Two Shoes," published some time before 1780, but
this may be a coincidence only.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Besides the interest and merit of these little books on literary grounds,
these earlier editions are especially noteworthy

<span class="pagenum"><a id="pageix" name="pageix"></a>[ix]</span>

                                                 because they were
illustrated by the painter William Mulready, and the drawings he made
for them are amongst the earliest efforts of his genius: they were
executed before he had reached man's estate. It is not a little
curious to observe in this connection how many artists who have
risen to eminence have at the outset of their career been employed
in illustrating books for children; it would indeed appear that until
comparatively recent years the veriest tiro was considered capable of
furnishing the necessary embellishments for books for the nursery&mdash;a
state of things which, we need not say, happily does not obtain in
the present day. Notwithstanding this, however, these and many other
little books of a bygone time abound in instructive indications of the
beginnings of genius which has subsequently delighted the world with
its masterpieces.
</p>
<p>
In connection with Mulready and children's books it may be interesting
to note that in 1806 a little book called "The Looking Glass" was
published, said to be written by William Godwin under the name of
"Theophilus Markliffe." This work is the history and early adventures of
a young artist, and it is known that it was compiled from a conversation
with Mulready, who was then engaged in illustrating some juvenile books
for the author, and the facts in it relate to the painter's early life.
It contains illustrations of the talent of the subject

<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagex" name="pagex"></a>[x]</span>

                                                        done at three,
five, and six years old, which are presumed to be imitations of
Mulready's own drawings at the same ages.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
I cannot more fitly close these few words of Introduction than by
quoting the quaint and curious announcement with which Mr Harris was
wont to commend these little books to the public. "It is unnecessary,"
says he, "for the publisher to say anything more of these little
productions than that they have been purchased with avidity and read
with satisfaction by persons in all ranks of life." No doubt the public
of to-day will be curious to see what manner of book it was that was so
eagerly sought after by the children of the early days of the present
century, and interested in comparing it with the more finished but often
showy and sensational productions of our own time.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
